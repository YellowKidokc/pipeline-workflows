"""Pick list: choose which notes of a folder go to the API, the same way in every folder.

                                   tick the ones you want ( - [x] ), in Obsidian or any editor
    <Channel>/_PICK.md             a channel folder (it has Clean MD/, Channel Summary/, Prompts/): the list sits in
                                   the channel folder and lists the notes in Clean MD/
    @list.txt                      an item starting with @ is a file of note paths, one per line (always run)

Rules every API station follows (resolve() below):
  - a file named directly is always run (you chose it);
  - a folder with a _PICK.md runs only the ticked notes;
  - a folder without one runs everything if it holds at most PICK_FREE notes; above that it writes a _PICK.md,
    runs nothing from that folder and says so, so a 300-video channel never goes to the API by accident;
  - "_PICK.md" with a line "ALL" (on its own) runs the whole folder.

Re-running write_pick() adds new notes unticked and keeps every tick. Standard titling renames notes and
updates [[links]] in the same folder, so ticks survive the rename.

    python -m engine.pick <folder>            write/refresh the list and print it
