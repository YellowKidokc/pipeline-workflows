# ONE_MENU

One portable folder, two batch files, every API pipeline. Open the folder and you see only:

```
ONE_MENU.bat    run anything: pick by number, answer a few questions, watch every step
SETUP.bat       once after copying or moving the folder (key, paths, hiding)
LEAN\           1 RUN ALL.bat, 2 RUN PRIORITY ONLY.bat, INBOX\, OUTBOX\   (station 55)
QUICK_CALL\     a one-off DeepSeek job in a folder you copy: prompt.txt + input\ -> RUN.bat -> output\
_system\        (hidden) engine, stations, config, legacy scripts, logs  <- this README lives here
_data\          (hidden) transcripts, papers, working folders, receipts
```

Every front folder looks the same: a few numbered .bat files you click without thinking, then `INBOX\` (00_PRIORITY,
01_SERIES\<series>, 02_GROUP\<group>) and `OUTBOX\`, where every paper is printed flat into the root (receipts and
working folders stay in `_data`). More front folders (claims, evidence, YouTube) follow the same shape.

Double-click `ONE_MENU.bat`, pick what to run by number (one, several, or a routine letter), answer a few
questions, and it runs in parallel: every result lands in a predictable place and every step is shown as it
happens. `ONE_MENU.bat results` opens the hidden results folder. The individual station scripts are still in
`_system\stations\NN_NAME\` when you want one on its own.

## First use

1. Install Python 3.11+ and `pip install openpyxl` (for the .xlsx outputs). Optional, used when present:
   `textstat`, `vaderSentiment`, `spacy` (more statistics), `requests` and `openai` (some legacy scripts; the
   `openai` package is only a client library, it talks to DeepSeek).
2. Run `SETUP.bat`. It
   - checks `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; if it is missing it asks for it once and saves it in your Windows user environment
     variables (`setx`). The key never goes in any file here. Already set under Windows environment variables? It
     just says so.
   - creates `_system\config\paths.json` from `paths.example.json`. By default all data lives in `_data\` next to
     `_system\` (relative paths, so it moves with the folder). Point any key at an existing folder instead, e.g.
     `yt_subtitles` at your current subtitles folder.
   - hides `_system` and `_data`.
3. Run `ONE_MENU.bat`.

## The menu

```
1  What to run?     one number, several ("8 9 44"), or a routine letter ("Y"). Enter = repeat last run
2  Options          it counts first ("Found 1,000 transcripts in <channel>, 312 already done"), then asks:
                    all or how many? · how many in parallel? (default 30; 50 or 60 if you like) · provider · redo?
                    (only the options the chosen stations really accept)
3  Anything else?   shows everything that will run, then: "Is there anything else you want to add?"
                    one line each, or a saved focus number; you can save what you typed for next time
4  Run it?          then every step is printed live and saved as steps.log
```

If a run is interrupted, the next start offers to resume it; finished items are skipped, so only the items
that were mid-flight are redone. Each item is saved the moment it finishes (one for one).

Without questions:

```bat
ONE_MENU.bat 30 --limit 1 --focus "entropy"
ONE_MENU.bat Y --channel "Daily Dose Of Wisdom" --workers 50
ONE_MENU.bat 40 --limit 1
ONE_MENU.bat 48 49 --topic resurrection
ONE_MENU.bat find resurrection --min 5
ONE_MENU.bat goals                      (every API goal id, also in API_GOALS.md)
ONE_MENU.bat 40 --mock --limit 1        (fake replies, no key, no cost: tests the plumbing)
```

**What kind of channel is this?** Whenever a run includes YouTube stations the menu asks: Theology, Physics,
Conspiracy, Patterns or none (remembered per channel; station 01 asks right after a grab). Choosing one adds the CKG
index (03) and that domain's own stations right after it: Theology adds 10 CKG_THEOLOGY, Physics adds 11 CKG_PHYSICS.
Each is preselected and can be declined. Add domains or stations in `config/domains.json`. Without questions:
`ONE_MENU.bat Y --channel "Some Channel" --domain theology`.

**Top 20** starts empty on purpose: put the numbers and routine letters you use most in `config/top20.json`.
The menu suggests candidates from your run history; the full list is always shown underneath.

Routines (`config/routines.json`): **T** YouTube tidy (07 12 13) · **Y** YouTube chain (07 02 12 13 08 09 44 46) · **I** CKG index + lenses + catalog ·
**P** paper complete (40 41 42 44 46) · **B** bridge (44 48 49) · **E** evidence intake · **A** evidence synthesis family.

## The bridge layer (why all of this exists)

`48 --topic resurrection` finds every paper, video and EVIDENCE companion that is really about the topic (tag score or
local pass), extracts every argument from each (one whole-source call each, all in parallel), cross-references them
into distinct arguments ranked by how many independent sources make them, writes the strongest form of each with
objections and replies, and builds a multi-page report. `49 --topic resurrection` then lays that over your own work
(papers made with `47 --own`, or files under `own_work`) and tells you where to **expand**, which objections are
**holes**, which claims to **contract**, who to **cite** because they reached the same conclusion first, and what
looks **original** in this corpus. Citations are always assembled from the source records, never written by the
model; anything from the model's general knowledge is marked "verify". Reports land in
`<syntheses_root>/<topic>/03_REPORT/`.

## Inboxes: priority, series, group

Stations that take files in read one inbox shape (`engine/inbox.py`): `00_PRIORITY/` first, then
`01_SERIES/<series>/`, then `02_GROUP/<group>/`. A group is carried through like a series without being
one (e.g. all the one-pagers); the folder name is the group's name and it travels into the outputs. The scripts
never sit in these folders: `paths.json` points at them. 55_LEAN_PAPERS uses it now (`lean_inbox`).

## Focus: your extra requests, next to the call

Three levels, appended to every prompt under `## EXTRA FOCUS FROM DAVID:`: the station's `FOCUS.md` (always),
the item's `01_NOTES/FOCUS.md` or the channel's saved focus (that item or channel), and what you type at question 3
(that run). Focus adds attention; it never removes the station's normal job. The receipt records the exact focus
text and hash. Legacy scripts receive it through the relay (below), or through their own flag (04 `--ask`).

## Parallel: many independent calls, one limit

Default 30 calls at once (question 2 or `--workers`). Every call from every station, new or legacy, passes through
one local relay (`engine/gateway.py`) that holds the only limiter, so papers x ranges x arms x stations never add up
past the limit. 429 / 5xx / timeouts retry with backoff; if more than 10% fail within a minute the limit halves, then
creeps back. One item = one whole-document call; only outputs are split (e.g. 80 sentences per range, all ranges in
parallel). A failed item never stops the batch.

## Providers

**DeepSeek only.** `settings.json` → `allowed_providers` is `deepseek` (plus `mock`, the fake replies used by the
tests, which never leave the machine). The relay refuses every other provider, for new and legacy scripts alike,
even if another key is set on the machine, and there is no fallback: a DeepSeek call that still fails after its
retries is recorded as failed and the item is retried on the next run. The menu does not ask for a provider.

`config/providers.json` still lists OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Moonshot/Kimi, Gemini, Groq, Together, Mistral
and Ollama, so switching one on later is two edits in `settings.json`: add it to `allowed_providers`, and (for a
backup) put it in `fallback` (the note there has the free OpenRouter line ready to paste).

## Outputs

Every station run on an item writes, in `02_RUNS/NN_STATION/<date>/` (never overwritten):
`.json` (canonical) · `.xlsx` (its rows) · `.html` (public section) · `.run.json` (receipt: source hash, model,
prompt version, focus text + hash, tokens, time, errors) · `.md` where there is prose · `calls/<goal id>-<n>.json`
(every reply, with its API goal id) · `steps.log` (every step). Items share one folder shape
(`templates/PAPER_FOLDER`): papers under `papers_root`, videos under `yt_work/<Channel>/`.

Station 46 assembles all of it: `03_REPORT/aggregate.json|md` (every station's JSON in the order in
`config/assembly.json`, missing ones listed), `report.html` (the approved statistics matrix, fed with real data; a
chart without data says what it is waiting for), `report.xlsx` (one tab per station), and any Excel template you map
in `config/excel_templates/` (see `tools/excel_fill.py`).

## Statistics: Python first

Station 42 computes every metric it can in Python, so the same paper gives the same numbers every time, and marks
each one `python`, `python-heuristic`, `library:<name>`, `python:<suite>` or `api`. Your own suites (the Paper
Intelligence suite, `X:\Python API`) plug in through `config/metric_suites.json`; the July grader's two engines are
already on. `python stations/42_STATISTICS_WALL/42_statistics_wall.py --audit-suites` lists what each suite folder
contains and which scripts answer `--help`.

## Moving the folder

Nothing inside holds a path: internal paths come from `engine/paths.py`, external ones from `config/paths.json`
by key. After a move, `SETUP.bat` checks every key and finds moved ones again (same position relative to
API_HOME, same path on another drive letter, or a search by folder name + parent + fingerprint file), asks you to
confirm (`--auto` accepts), saves, and runs the health check.

## Pulling the nested API folders up

`python _system\tools\pull_up_api_folders.py "<your pipeline-workflows folder>"` previews moving every station folder
out of `API\API`, `API\API 2` and `API\API 3` into the main folder, numbered (`01_CKG` ...), and renames the old
OpenAI quick-call folder to `QUICK_CALL_OLD`. Plumbing folders (INBOX, OUTBOX, SCRIPTS ...) stay. Add `--apply` to
move (logged in `PULL_UP_LOG.csv`), `--undo` to put everything back. It never overwrites, flags same-named folders,
and flags scripts that point at their parent folder (those can break when moved).

## Legacy code

The gathered scripts are copied into `vendor/` by `tools/migrate_legacy.py`, which rewrites every hard-coded path to a
`paths.json` key and every provider URL to the relay, fixes the data bugs it knows about, and writes
`MIGRATION_REPORT.md` (every change, file and line). After you update a live script, copy it into the gathered folder
and re-run the tool. See `CONSOLIDATION.md` for what was merged, what is proposed, and what was retired.

## Tests

`python -m unittest discover -s tests` runs everything offline with `--mock`, including the full Y, P, 48 and 49 chains.

## Still yours to decide

1. The YouTube download location: `yt_subtitles` is the ONE location now (grab writes, the chain reads); point it at
   `subtitles\` or `E:\YouTube\channels` in `paths.json`.
2. The 12 headline numbers (a provisional 12 is in `42_statistics_wall.py`; see real numbers first).
3. The canonical axiom registry (AXIOMS_PART1 is used and named in every output; `axiom_registry` switches it).
4. The Fruits sentence scale (-2..+2 in use, marked provisional in `fruits_plugin/plugin.json`) vs 0-4.
5. Which api_call stations get their own number (all 23 run under 60, bundled).
6. Whether YouTube transcripts also run the analytical arms (40 works on videos when given them).
7. Which lexicon wins when the two Excel workbooks disagree (merged for now, source recorded).
8. Academic benchmarks for the matrix (`config/academic_norms.json`, empty until you add sources).
