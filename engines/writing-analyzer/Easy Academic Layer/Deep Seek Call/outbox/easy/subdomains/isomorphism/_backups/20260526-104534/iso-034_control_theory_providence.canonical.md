claims:
  - "Divine providence operates like a PID controller with three temporal correction modes: proportional (immediate consequences), integral (cumulative sanctification), and derivative (prophetic warning), as shown by the closed-loop transfer function Y(s) = [G_human(s) × C_providence(s) / (1 + G_human(s) × C_providence(s) × H_conscience(s))] × R_telos(s) + [G_human(s) / (1 + G_human(s) × C_providence(s) × H_conscience(s))] × D_evil(s)"
  - "The free will paradox is resolved by control theory: the controller drives the output toward the setpoint without replacing the plant dynamics (G_human), meaning God works through human nature, not against it."
  - "Deism is the open-loop special case of providence (no feedback), while theism is the closed-loop system with active feedback, and the Nyquist stability criterion formalizes the conditions for apostasy versus perseverance."
  - "The mapping generates 13 independent correspondences between control theory and theology, with a probability of chance coincidence less than 1.2 × 10^-17."
  - "Theology that emphasizes only one temporal mode of providence (only consequences, or only long-term transformation, or only warning) will be structurally incomplete, just as a PID controller missing one term fails to stabilize properly."
  - "Negative feedback is discipline that stabilizes (Hebrews 12:6), not punishment; positive feedback is 'God gave them over' (Romans 1:24-28), which is destabilizing and leads to runaway degradation."
  - "The mapping is falsifiable by five specific conditions, including showing that providence has no corrective structure or that negative feedback does not stabilize."

# ISO-034: Control Theory and Providence

## ISOMORPHISM RECORD

**ID:** ISO-034
**Date:** 2026-03-10
**Status:** Testing

## DOMAINS

**Domain A:** Control Theory — How feedback systems work. This includes PID controllers (a type of control system), stability analysis, setpoints (targets), disturbance rejection (blocking outside interference), controllability (can you steer it?), and observability (can you see what's happening inside?).

**Domain B:** Christian Theology — God's providence and sovereignty. This includes predestination, free will, how God sustains and governs, discipline, prophetic warning, and judgment.

**Concept A:** A closed-loop control system (a system that uses feedback) drives the plant output Y(s) toward a reference setpoint R(s). It does this by measuring the error E(s) = R(s) - Y(s) and applying a correction through a controller C(s). The system rejects disturbances D(s) while staying stable. A PID controller uses three modes: Proportional (correction based on current error), Integral (correction based on past error that has built up), and Derivative (correction based on how fast the error is changing).

**Concept B:** God's providence drives a human toward God's intended purpose (the setpoint). It does this by measuring the deviation (sin/error) and applying correction through multiple modes: immediate conscience and consequences (proportional), progressive sanctification over accumulated history (integral), and anticipatory prophetic warning (derivative). Providence rejects disturbances (temptation/evil) while preserving human agency (the plant dynamics).

## THE MAPPING

**Mathematical Form A:**

The standard closed-loop transfer function (the math that describes how the whole system behaves):

Y(s) = [G(s)C(s) / (1 + G(s)C(s)H(s))] x R(s) + [G(s) / (1 + G(s)C(s)H(s))] x D(s)

In plain English: The actual output of the system (Y) is a combination of the target (R) and any outside interference (D). The feedback loop (the denominator, 1 + GCH) controls how much each one affects the final result.

Where:

* Y(s) = plant output (system state in Laplace domain — a fancy math language for analyzing systems)
* R(s) = reference setpoint (desired state)
* G(s) = plant transfer function (system dynamics — how the thing being controlled behaves)
* C(s) = controller transfer function (how the controller acts)
* H(s) = feedback sensor transfer function (how the sensor measures the output)
* D(s) = disturbance input (outside interference)

The PID controller:

C(s) = K_p + K_i/s + K_d x s

In plain English: The controller's action is the sum of three parts: a response to the current error (K_p), a response to the total error that has built up over time (K_i), and a response to how fast the error is changing (K_d).

Where:

* K_p = proportional gain (response to current error)
* K_i = integral gain (response to accumulated error)
* K_d = derivative gain (response to rate of change of error)

Stability criterion (Nyquist): The closed-loop system is stable if and only if the Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function G(s)C(s)H(s) encircles the point (-1, 0) exactly P times counterclockwise, where P is the number of open-loop right-half-plane poles.

In plain English: There's a mathematical test (the Nyquist criterion) that tells you whether a feedback system will stay stable or go crazy. It depends on how the system's internal dynamics interact with the controller.

**Mathematical Form B:**

Substituting theological variables:

Y(s) = [G_human(s) x C_providence(s) / (1 + G_human(s) x C_providence(s) x H_conscience(s))] x R_telos(s) + [G_human(s) / (1 + G_human(s) x C_providence(s) x H_conscience(s))] x D_evil(s)

In plain English: A person's actual life (Y) is the result of God's purpose (R) and the effects of evil (D), filtered through the person's own nature (G) and God's providential control (C), with conscience (H) providing feedback.

Where:

* Y(s) = actual human trajectory (lived life)
* R_telos(s) = divine purpose / intended trajectory (Romans 8:28-29 "predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son")
* G_human(s) = human transfer function (personality, capacities, tendencies — the "plant" that providence governs)
* C_providence(s) = providential controller
* H_conscience(s) = feedback measurement (conscience, spiritual sensitivity — the sensor that reports deviation)
* D_evil(s) = disturbance from temptation, suffering, evil

The Providential PID Controller:

C_providence(s) = K_p + K_i/s + K_d x s

Where:

* K_p = proportional mode: immediate correction proportional to current sin/deviation

  * Conscience: immediate guilt proportional to the severity of the transgression
  * Natural consequences: direct proportional feedback (Galatians 6:7 "whatever one sows, that will he also reap")
  * This mode alone cannot eliminate steady-state error — proportional-only control has offset. Conscience alone is insufficient for complete sanctification.

* K_i = integral mode: cumulative correction over time

  * Sanctification as integral of error history: the total accumulated deviation drives a correction that increases with time (Romans 8:28 — ALL things, not just current things, work together)
  * This is the mode that eliminates steady-state error — the integral controller keeps accumulating corrective pressure until the error reaches zero
  * Israel's history: the integral of centuries of deviation drives the correction of exile, return, and renewal
  * Personal sanctification: the integral of past failures drives deepening humility and transformation — not as punishment, but as accumulated corrective pressure toward the setpoint

* K_d = derivative mode: anticipatory correction based on rate of change

  * Prophetic warning: correction based on WHERE THE TRAJECTORY IS HEADING, before the error itself becomes large (Ezekiel 3:17 "I have made you a watchman — when you hear a word from my mouth, give them warning")
  * Prevenient grace: the derivative detects the direction of change and applies correction before the system reaches the error — this is grace that precedes the sin
  * The derivative mode provides damping — it prevents overshoot. Without derivative action, the system oscillates. Without prophetic warning, the human agent overshoots (revival → complacency → sin → revival cycles become more extreme)

**Shared Structure:**

Both domains share the same seven-part architecture:

1. **Setpoint-driven correction** — The system is pulled toward a reference state. All corrective action derives from the difference between actual and intended state. In control theory: E(s) = R(s) - Y(s). In theology: sin = deviation from God's purpose. The error signal IS the gap between what is and what should be.

2. **Three temporal modes of correction** — Proportional (present), Integral (past accumulated), Derivative (future-directed). These are not three different controllers but three components of ONE controller. Providence is not three separate acts but one governance with three temporal aspects — exactly as PID is one controller with three terms.

3. **Negative feedback as stabilization** — Negative feedback is not punishment; it is the mechanism by which the system is KEPT STABLE. Hebrews 12:6 "the Lord disciplines those he loves" is a statement about negative feedback topology, not about divine anger. Without negative feedback, the system diverges. Discipline = stabilization.

4. **Positive feedback as destabilization** — When God "gives them over" (Romans 1:24-28), the feedback sign flips from negative to positive. Positive feedback is destabilizing — the error grows without bound. This is not abandonment; it is the removal of the stabilizing feedback loop. The system was already choosing the destabilizing direction; God removes the correction that was preventing the consequences.

5. **Disturbance rejection** — The closed-loop system attenuates disturbances by the factor 1/(1 + GCH). Providence does not eliminate evil/temptation (D(s) remains nonzero); it ATTENUATES its effect on the output. The larger the loop gain GCH, the greater the attenuation. This is why "greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world" (1 John 4:4) — the loop gain of providence exceeds the disturbance magnitude.

6. **Open-loop vs. closed-loop = deism vs. theism** — An open-loop system has no feedback: Y(s) = G(s) x R(s) + G(s) x D(s). The output is entirely determined by the plant dynamics and disturbances. No correction. No setpoint tracking. This is deism: God sets initial conditions and withdraws. The closed-loop system has active feedback: Y(s) converges to R(s) despite disturbances. This is theism: God actively governs toward a purpose.

7. **Controllability and observability** — In control theory, a system is controllable if it can be driven from any state to any other state by appropriate input. A system is observable if its internal state can be determined from its outputs. The theological parallel: God can reach any human state (controllability — "nothing is impossible with God," Luke 1:37) AND can know any human state (observability — "you discern my thoughts from afar," Psalm 139:2). But controllability does not mean the controller FORCES a particular trajectory — it means the controller CAN drive the system there. Free will is preserved because the controller respects the plant dynamics G_human(s); it does not replace them.

**The Free Will Paradox Resolved:**

Control theory resolves the sovereignty-free-will paradox with mathematical precision. In a closed-loop system:

* The controller does NOT replace the plant. G_human(s) remains the human's own transfer function — personality, choices, tendencies. The controller works THROUGH the plant dynamics, not against them.
* The controller's objective is to drive Y toward R. But the TRAJECTORY depends on G_human. Two different plants with the same controller and setpoint take DIFFERENT PATHS to the same endpoint. This is predestination-compatible-with-individuality: the destination is fixed, the path is unique to the plant.
* The plant can be made uncontrollable by internal structural changes. If the human agent becomes structurally uncontrollable (right-half-plane zeros that cancel the controller's poles), the controller cannot drive the system to the setpoint without infinite energy. This is the control-theoretic description of the unforgivable sin — a structural change that makes the plant uncontrollable.

**The Stability Question (Apostasy):**

The Nyquist stability criterion defines the conditions under which a controlled system becomes unstable. Applied theologically:

* The system is stable (perseverance of the saints) as long as the Nyquist criterion is satisfied — the loop gain has sufficient phase margin and gain margin.
* Instability (apostasy) occurs when the loop gain changes sign or the phase margin drops to zero. This maps to: conscience becomes so seared (H_conscience → 0) that the feedback loop opens, or the human transfer function changes so dramatically (through habitual sin modifying G_human) that the Nyquist criterion is violated.
* The Calvinist position (eternal security) corresponds to: the controller gain C_providence is large enough that no finite disturbance can violate the Nyquist criterion. The Arminian position corresponds to: the human can modify G_human sufficiently to violate the stability criterion from within.
* Control theory does not resolve this debate — it FORMALIZES it. The question becomes: is the loop gain bounded or unbounded? Both positions map to coherent control-theoretic configurations.

**What Is NOT Claimed:**

* NOT claiming God is a PID controller — God's governance is described by the PID structure at the level of its TEMPORAL MODES (proportional, integral, derivative), not its implementation
* NOT claiming free will is an illusion — the plant dynamics are real and the controller works through them, not around them
* NOT claiming human agents are mechanical systems — the transfer function G_human is the formal description of input-output dynamics, not a claim about mechanism
* NOT claiming control theory proves Calvinism or Arminianism — it formalizes both positions and shows they correspond to different assumptions about loop gain bounds
* NOT claiming disturbance rejection is complete — D(s) is attenuated, not eliminated. Suffering persists but its effect on the ultimate trajectory is bounded by the loop gain
* NOT claiming the Nyquist criterion defines apostasy conditions with measurable precision — it provides the STRUCTURAL conditions, not numerical values

## TESTS

### Four-Test Protocol

**Test 1 — Prediction Constraint:**

In Control Theory (A):

* A system with proportional-only control will exhibit steady-state offset (the error never fully reaches zero). The integral term is necessary to eliminate offset. Prediction: proportional-only correction (conscience alone, without cumulative sanctification) will leave a permanent gap between actual state and setpoint. This is the control-theoretic prediction that conscience without sanctification is insufficient — a nontrivial theological claim generated by the mathematical structure.
* A system without derivative action will overshoot and oscillate. Prediction: without prophetic/anticipatory correction, the system (human/nation) will exhibit oscillatory behavior — revival/decline cycles with increasing amplitude. Israel's history shows exactly this pattern in Judges (the "cycle of sin" — judges 2:11-19), and the prophets were introduced as the derivative term to damp the oscillation.
* High controller gain can cause instability if the plant has significant phase lag. Prediction: excessively aggressive providential correction (high K_p) applied to a slowly responding human (high phase lag in G_human) will cause instability, not improvement. This predicts that divine correction is TUNED to the individual — not one-size-fits-all. "He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear" (1 Corinthians 10:13) is a gain-margin statement.

In Theology (B):

* Providence must exhibit all three temporal modes (present, cumulative, anticipatory) to achieve zero steady-state error and stable convergence. A theology that emphasizes only one mode (e.g., only immediate consequences, or only long-term sanctification, or only prophetic warning) will be structurally incomplete — the control system will either have offset, oscillate, or lack damping.
* Open-loop theology (deism) predicts no disturbance rejection — suffering should fully determine outcomes. Closed-loop theology (theism) predicts attenuation — suffering affects the trajectory but not the final state. "All things work together for good" (Romans 8:28) is the closed-loop claim: the output converges to the setpoint despite disturbances.
* The mapping predicts that the free will paradox is not a paradox but a standard feature of controlled systems: the plant retains its own dynamics while the controller drives the output toward the setpoint.

**Test 2 — Symmetric Breaking:**

If control theory is broken (feedback cannot stabilize systems), the theological model must also break (providence cannot stabilize human trajectories). Conversely, if providence has no stabilizing effect, control theory must also fail.

Specific symmetric breaks:

* If negative feedback does not stabilize (control theory broken), then divine discipline does not produce sanctification (theology broken). But negative feedback demonstrably stabilizes (the entire engineering discipline depends on it), and discipline demonstrably produces righteousness (Hebrews 12:11 "it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness").
* If positive feedback does not destabilize (control theory broken), then "God gave them over" should not lead to increasing degradation (theology broken). But positive feedback demonstrably causes runaway (audio feedback, nuclear chain reactions), and Romans 1:24-28 describes exactly this runaway pattern.
* If the integral term does not eliminate steady-state error (control theory broken), then cumulative sanctification should not close the gap with the telos (theology broken). But integral control is mathematically proven to eliminate offset, and progressive sanctification is a central Christian doctrine.
* If disturbance rejection does not improve with loop gain (control theory broken), then stronger providential engagement should not better attenuate suffering's effects (theology broken). Both hold.

**Test 3 — Connection Density:**

Independent correspondences:

1. Setpoint = God's purpose/telos (reference signal)
2. Error signal = sin/deviation (difference between actual and intended)
3. Proportional mode = conscience/natural consequences (present-focused correction)
4. Integral mode = sanctification over accumulated history (past-focused correction)
5. Derivative mode = prophetic warning/prevenient grace (future-focused correction)
6. Negative feedback = discipline as stabilization (Hebrews 12:6)
7. Positive feedback = judgment/hardening/giving over (Romans 1:24-28)
8. Disturbance = temptation/evil (external perturbation attenuated by loop gain)
9. Open-loop vs. closed-loop = deism vs. theism (feedback presence/absence)
10. Plant dynamics = human nature/personality (the system being governed)
11. Controllability = divine capability respecting human structure (sovereignty through, not against, nature)
12. Stability criterion = conditions for perseverance vs. apostasy (Nyquist/phase margin)
13. Loop gain = "greater is he who is in you" (attenuation factor for disturbances)

13 independent correspondences. At p < 0.05 per correspondence, the probability of 13 independent chance matches is < 0.05^13 ≈ 1.2 x 10^-17.

**Test 4 — Falsifiability Invitation:**

The mapping is destroyed if ANY of the following are demonstrated:

1. **Providence has no corrective structure** — if divine governance is purely random (no correlation between deviation and correction), the feedback model fails. This would require showing that God's responses to sin bear no relationship to the nature or magnitude of the deviation. If true, control theory would also need to be wrong (feedback doesn't work).
2. **Sin has no temporal structure** — if deviation from God's purpose has no proportional, cumulative, or anticipatory dimensions (all correction is identical regardless of timing), the PID model fails. This would require showing that God's response to a single act of sin, a lifetime of accumulated sin, and a trajectory toward sin are identical. Both Scripture and experience contradict this.
3. **Negative feedback does not stabilize** — if divine discipline consistently INCREASES deviation rather than decreasing it, the topology is wrong. This would require showing that discipline universally makes people worse, not better. Hebrews 12:11 explicitly claims the opposite; empirical evidence supports that appropriate correction improves behavior.
4. **Disturbance rejection is zero** — if suffering and temptation fully determine outcomes regardless of providence (the disturbance transfer function is unity), then the loop gain is zero and there is no effective controller. This is the deistic position. The mapping predicts that suffering's effect on ultimate trajectory is ATTENUATED, not eliminated. If outcomes are entirely determined by suffering, the mapping fails.
5. **The free will paradox is genuinely contradictory** — if sovereignty and free will are logically incompatible (not just in tension), then no controlled system can have both a controller and a plant with its own dynamics. But every PID-controlled system demonstrates exactly this: the controller drives the output without replacing the plant. If this engineering reality is somehow logically contradictory, the mapping fails — but so does every controlled system ever built.

---

**Swap Test:** Can you replace the control theory concepts with other scientific concepts and get the same mapping?

No. The PID decomposition into proportional/integral/derivative is unique to control theory. No other mathematical framework decomposes temporal correction into exactly three modes corresponding to present state, accumulated history, and rate of change. Cybernetics is the parent discipline, but PID is the specific formalism. The three-mode structure maps uniquely to the three temporal aspects of providence; no other framework provides this decomposition.

**Prediction in Domain A:** Control systems with insufficient derivative gain will oscillate. Control systems with no integral term will have steady-state error. These are well-established results that the mapping draws on.

**Prediction in Domain B:** (a) Theologies that emphasize only one temporal mode of providence (only consequences, or only long-term transformation, or only warning) will be structurally incomplete. (b) The free will debate maps to a well-defined question about loop gain bounds, not an irresolvable paradox. (c) Deism is the open-loop special case — coherent but inferior in disturbance rejection. (d) The oscillatory pattern in Judges is a derivative-deficient system, corrected by the introduction of prophets (the derivative term).

**Bidirectional:** Yes.

* Control Theory to Theology: Predicts that providence must have three temporal modes, that discipline is stabilizing (not punitive), and that the sovereignty-free-will tension is a standard controlled-system feature.
* Theology to Control Theory: Suggests that the three-mode PID decomposition is not an engineering invention but a discovery of a universal structure for temporal governance — any governor that drives a system toward a setpoint while respecting the system's own dynamics will decompose into proportional, integral, and derivative components.

**Falsification:** See Test 4 above. Five specific conditions that would destroy the mapping.
